# Introduction
Begin 2023 I was at the start of my career in the world of Kubernetes consultancy. I was already doing experience in the production environments of the Dutch government, but I was eager to learn and wanted to increase my value in the market besides just work experience, even if it meant spending many hours of my free time studying. 

I decided start this learning journey by obtaining the relevant certifications in the cloud-native landscape. In around half a year I managed to obtain 7 Red Hat Certifications, granting me the **Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA)** title, and in the following months I obtained the CNCF Kubernetes certifications (**CKA, CKAD** and **CKS**).

In this blog I will explain why I chose these certifications and evaluate if the time and effort spent were worthwhile.

# Why I chose these certifications
I wanted to specialize in Kubernetes and had an interest in Linux and Ansible. There are two primary organizations that offer industry-recognized certifications in these subjects: Red Hat and CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation). 

Not only were they industry-recognized, but they had 100% hands-on exams. I like practical exams. You get hands-on experience and have to prove that you know the material with a few hours time. For this reason they're also harder to obtain. A former Red Hat employee told me that the entry-level certification of Red Hat, RHCSA, has a success rate of 40% for the first attempt and 70% for the second attempt. Despite the exam being 3 hours long, most people struggle to finish the exam within 3 hours during the first attempt. I was lucky to pass the first time. 

This is pretty different from entry-level certifications of other organizations, where the vast majority passes the first time for their multiple-choice exam and do so within 30 minutes.

# Was It Worth It?
It took a lot of time and energy to study for a certification, having to finish a 3-4 hour long practical exam, and having to retake the exam if I failed doing so the first time, but it was fullfilling everytime I managed to obtain a certificate. Since it was as the start of my career in the cloud-native landscape, the knowledge of these certifications were more worth to me than they would be for a Senior Site Reliability Engineer with 10 years work experience. 

So after around half a year and passing 7 Red Hat certifications in a row I was granted the Red Hat Certified Architect title, which is one of the highest titles in the world of IT certifications, but I definitely didn't feel like an architect. And after passing CKA/CKAD/CKS I still didn't feel like a Kubernetes-guru. I was still just an ambitious engineer with less than 1 year of work experience. I definitely was not better or more knowledgable than all the seniors around me who have zero certifications, but plenty of work experience. That's why I try to avoid identifying myself with my certification credentials and titles, except for my resume or portfolio page.

Work experience is obviously one of the most important factors for career growth and obtaining knowledge, but there are also many other ways to grow your knowledge besides work experience or certifications. Learning a programming language, setting up technologies in your homelab cluster, writing an open-source git project, reading a well-written technical book, regularly engaging with blogs and conferences in the cloud-native landscape, all these things can be much more worthwhile for your learning journey than certifications do, for both junior and senior.

However, I'm still happy that I succeeded in my goal and finished obtaining the certifications. If I could have redone it, I would have done the same, but I would have put less pressure on my goal and combined it more with the other forms of knowledge that I mentioned in my previous paragraph. But I'm done now and I am now able to put my primary focus on that. And I'm in the consultancy field, so the certifications causes more trust to the clients. To them it proves atleast a minimal form of knowledge and showcases my eagerness to learn. For this reason it also benefitted me financially.

# Conclusion
Obtaining these certifications will benefit you if you enjoy a structured form of learning and it will benefit you the most if you are at the start of your career and are planning to get in the consultancy field. Or if you're doing a helpdesk job and want to break into the field of cloud, containerization and DevOps. However, you should not depend on certifications for your career growth. 

Try other things, like automating toil in your work environment, try to learn to program and write a Kubernetes controller, set up a Ceph or Kafka cluster on your K8s homelab, create an Ansible module, read some Kubernetes books from O'Reilly and Manning, check out blogs and see what other companies are doing (ex. sreweekly.com). There's so much more than certifications, but if you do choose to obtain certifications, the hands-on certifications of Red Hat and CNCF are definitely the best certifications out there.

So if you still wish to go on the journey of obtaining the Red Hat Certified (OpenShift) Architect title or CKA/CKS, I will wish you the best of luck!
