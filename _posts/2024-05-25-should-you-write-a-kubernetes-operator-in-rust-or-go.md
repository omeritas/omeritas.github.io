Kubernetes operators can be created using a variety of methods, including Ansible, Helm, Golang, Python, Rust, and even in Bash with curls to the Kubernetes API. The most popular framework for writing Kubernetes operators, Kubebuilder (along with the Operator SDK, which is based on Kubebuilder), supports the first three methods mentioned.


## The Language of the Cloud-Native Landscape 
Golang is the most popular choice for writing Kubernetes operators. Since Kubernetes is written in Go, its official Go library is the best supported. Golang also offers more options for customization, since it's a programming language, and is compatible with the Kubebuilder framework. Golang is known for its simplicity and speed. Many essential tools in the cloud-native landscape (such as Docker, Prometheus, Helm, Terraform etc.), are written in Go. This has made Golang the standard language among engineers in this field, similar to how Python is prevalent in AI and machine learning.

## Comparison with Rust
Rust, on the other hand, has a community Kubernetes library, allowing for the creation of cloud-native applications based on the Kubernetes API. However, Rust comes with its own set of challenges. Rust is neither simple to learn nor to develop with, taking longer to master compared to Golang. While Rust can be better than Go in terms of performance, the difference in speed is often negligible for typical use cases involving Kubernetes operators. Using Rust for both a private Kubernetes operator in an enterprise environment and as an open-source project could limit its support and maintenance due to the smaller pool of engineers in the DevOps/SRE landscape that have knowledge in Rust as compared to Go.

Given the maturity of the Go ecosystem for Kubernetes, the larger pool of engineers with Go expertise, the steeper learning curve of Rust, and the longer development time associated with Rust, it is generally more advisable to write your Kubernetes operator in Golang. However, if you or your company have more expertise in Rust as compared to Golang, then Rust might be a suitable choice for your specific needs.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the practical advantages of using Golang for writing Kubernetes operators (such as better support, a richer ecosystem, and a more extensive talent pool) make it the preferred choice for most developers and organizations. Rust, and more recently Zig, are starting to gain popularity, especially among younger developers. A passionate and vocal community is advocating for Rust to become the go-to language in the IT field, extending its use far beyond just embedded systems.
