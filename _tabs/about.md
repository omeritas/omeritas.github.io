# Ömer I. Tas  (Amsterdam, NL)

## Site Reliability Engineer & Kafka Specialist

Welcome to my personal page. I'm Ömer (24), a dedicated Site Reliability Engineer with a strong focus on data on Kubernetes. My expertise lies in a comprehensive set of technologies and tools, including:

- **Kubernetes & Building Operators**
- **Apache Kafka**
- **Observability** 
- **Linux Internals**


In my technical blog I will mostly focus on this set of technologies. I have worked for several big companies and organisations, such as: **Conclusion, Eneco, Terberg Group and the Dutch government**.

### My Approach & Credentials

My commitment to continuous learning is demonstrated through regular engagement with technical literature, blogs, hands-on experimentation in my home lab, learning from the experiences of other companies, and attaining Kubernetes-related certifications and titles, such as: 
- **Red Hat Certified OpenShift Architect** (RHCOA, 8 OpenShift Certifications)
- **Red Hat Certified Architect in Infrastructure level VI** (RHCA VI, 10+ Red Hat Certifications)
- **Certified Kubernetes Administrator, Developer and Security Specialist** (CKA, CKAD, CKS) 

### My Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy sports such as weightlifting, swimming, and playing padel. I also like to cook and read non-fiction books. While I no longer watch much TV or play video games (very occasionally), I hold a special appreciation for games like Civilization, Crusader Kings, OSRS and of TV series such as Succession and Better Call Saul. I regularly play with technologies on my self-hosted k8s cluster.

### Let's Connect

I'm always open to make new connections and explore opportunities. Feel free to drop me an email at omerilyastas@gmail.com.
