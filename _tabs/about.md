# Ömer I. Tas  

## Site Reliability Engineer

I'm Ömer (24, Netherlands), a dedicated and self-taught Site Reliability Engineer with a focus on event-driven and distributed systems, such as **Kubernetes** and **Apache Kafka**.


In my technical blog I will mostly focus on this set of technologies. I have worked for several big companies and organisations, such as: **Conclusion, Eneco** and the **Dutch government**.

### My Approach 

My commitment to continuous learning is demonstrated through regular engagement with technical literature, blogs, hands-on experimentation, and attaining certifications and titles, such as: 
- **Red Hat Certified OpenShift Architect** (RHCOA, 8 OpenShift Certifications)
- **Red Hat Certified Architect in Infrastructure level VI** (RHCA VI, 10+ Red Hat Certifications)
- **Certified Kubernetes Administrator, Developer and Security Specialist** (CKA, CKAD, CKS) 

### My Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy sports such as weightlifting, swimming, and playing padel. I also like to cook and read (non-fiction). While I no longer watch much TV or play video games (very occasionally), I hold a special appreciation for strategy/fighting games and of TV series such as Succession and Better Call Saul. I regularly play with technologies on my self-hosted k8s cluster.

### Let's Connect

I'm always open to make new connections and explore opportunities. Feel free to drop me an email at omerilyastas@gmail.com.
